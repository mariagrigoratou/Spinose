In the folder excel_summary you can find the summary for model output for all the simulations. 
To run the code first run the "Plankton_Size_Chemostat.py" file then "save_od.py" file. Before you run the "save_od.py" if you want to save the model output on an excel file, you need to define the name and the directory for the excel output. You can do that on line 138, file "save_od.py". If you don't want to save the output, you need to comment the lines 120-205 of the file "save_od.py". 

If you want to replicate the figures from the SM you can use the code "figures_code_example.py". To run the file, you need to define which csv you want to plot and the cell numbers for each plausible, low- biomass or other simulation.
